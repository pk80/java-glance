## Fundamentals Course outline
1. Input-Output
2. Variables
3. Data types
   1. Primitive
      - byte
      - short
      - char
      - boolean
      - int
      - long
      - float
      - double
   2. Non-Primitive
      - String
      - Array
      - Class
      - Object
      - Interface
4. Conditional statements
5. Loops
6. All about patterns
7. Methods/Functions
   1. Enter 3 numbers from the user & make a function to print their average.
   2. Write a function to print the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n.
   3. Write a function which takes in 2 numbers and returns the greater of those two.
   4. Write a function that takes in the radius as input and returns the circumference of a circle.
   5. Write a function that takes in age as input and returns if that person is eligible to vote or not. A person of age > 18 is eligible to vote.
   6. Write an infinite loop using do while condition.
   7. Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end it should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered. 
   8. Two numbers are entered by the user, x and n. Write a function to find the value of one number raised to the power of another i.e. xn.
   9. Write a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor of 2 numbers. (BONUS)
   10. Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user : 
         0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ..... 
         In the Fibonacci series, a number is the sum of the previous 2 numbers that came before it. (BONUS)
8. Space & Time complexity
   - relation between input size and running time(operations)
   - time complexity is directly proportional to code operations
   - comparing : big O(n) < O(n^2) < O(n^3)
   - space complexity is dependent on the space occupied(number of variables)
   - space is constant irrespective of the size of the variable
   - space id directly dependent on size of variable in case of arrays
9.  Arrays
10. 2D Arrays
11. String
12. String Builder
13. Bit Manipulation

## Intermediate course outline
1. Sorting
   1. Bubble sort
   2. Selection sort
   3. Insertion sort
2. Recursion
   1. Iterations/Loops
   2. Functions
   - Recursions are vastly used in java tress and java graphs
   - Recursion is a function that calls itself
   - Recursion without base case results in STACK OVERFLOW
   - Recursion uses multiple stack memory spaces as long as base case is satisfied!
